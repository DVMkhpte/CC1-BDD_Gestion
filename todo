Fonction de TEST
One of the best way to find bugs (whether security or not) is to
use dynamic security tools thus
â€“ Look at valgrind/fuzzers (honggfuzz or AFL++) and sanitizers and
integrate them in your code when testing and report on some bug they
found and how you patched them. You can see electric fence as well
even though I have mixed feelings on it.
